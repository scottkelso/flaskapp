# flaskapp

This is an example application that can show the sending of text and images to
and from a backend API.

## Prerequisits
* brew
* python3
* browser

## How to setup
1. Ensure you have Homebrew installed (by visiting https://brew.sh) so that you
can install the other prerequisits (python3, its package manager pip, and the
project requirements)

Install Homebrew with `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
Install Python3 with `brew install python3`
Ensure you have pip3 with `pip3 --version` and if not use `sudo -H python -m ensurepip` to install

2. Clone this repository and ensure you have installed all requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the backend with `python3 app.py`

4. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and hopefully all goes well!
